Work in process code for verified deriving of instances in Idris.
Allows deriving of instances for 
* Boolean Equality 
* Decidable Equality
* Comparison (Ord)
* Functor
* Foldable
* Traversable
Including proofs that their expected algebraic laws hold.

Work based on @ahmadsalim's [MSc Thesis](http://itu.dk/people/asal/pubs/msc-thesis-report.pdf) which was inspired by a lot of other work on generics, dependent types and levitation.
